## Goal
<p> Create a simple Calculator using C# and .Net Framework that allows the user to choose in between make simple calculations as sum, subtract, divide and multiply or statistical calculations such as total sum, avarage (mean), Variance and Standard Deviation given a set of numbers.</p>

## How it works
Starting the console application you as a user can choose either the simple calculator to make simple calculations or the Statistics calculator.

### simple calculator
The simple calculator allows you to make the 4 main calculation: add, subtract, multiply and divide.
The user will enter the frist number, the operator and the second number and recieve the result. 

The operator can be:
1. "Add" or "+"
2. "subtract" or "-"
3. "multiply" or "*"
4. "divide" or "/"

Example: 

``` 
> 1 
> + 
> 4 
< He is the result 5 
```

### Statistics calculator
The Statistics calculator allows you as a user to input a infinit set of numbers and in return get te total sum, avarage (mean), Variance and Standard Deviation.
The numbers need to be separate by comman (,).

Example:

``` 
> 4,5,6,7,8
< Results:
< Sum: 30
< Avarage (mean): 6
< Variance: 2.5
< Standard Deviation: 1.4142
```

observations: all the results has a max fixed of 4 decimal cases.

## Unit Test
All the unit test were written using Microsoft unit test framework for managed code and Visual Studio Test Explorer.

## Concepts
This calculator was developed in order to learn and understand some C# and .Net Framework basic concepts and remember some of oriented-objects programming concepts, are they:

1. C# basic syntax 
2. C# Try-catch-finally statement and exceptions 
3. How to convert string to number using C#
4. Data Structs in C#
5. String manipulation in c#
6. Obejects and classes (remenber the concepts and c# syntax)
7. Methos statics vs non-static (remenber the concepts and c# syntax)
8. Unit tests
